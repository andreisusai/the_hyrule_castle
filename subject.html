            <p>During this project, you will build a little RPG and decide on which game mechanics you wish to implement.</p>
            <p>First, you will have to make the basis of the game. Then, you will be able to pick mods out of a given list. Each mod you successfully implement will give you additional points, based on their difficulty.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Once you are done with the Base Game, you have to put it in a <code>base_game/</code> folder, for correction purposes. You can then use a copy of it for the modded game. The modded game has to be in a <code>mods/</code> folder and every mod in a different file.<br>For instance, if you implement the mods <b>More Statistics</b> and <b>Better Combat Options</b>, we will have inside the <code>mods/</code> folder <code>hyrule_castle.sh</code>, <code>more_statistics.sh</code> and <code>better_combat_options.sh</code>.</p>
            <p>You can then use your mod's function your main file by using <code>source</code>.</p>
            <p>Also, it is highly recommended to plan ahead and decide how many mods and much many you will implement, rather than adding each mod on top of the other.</p>
            <p>Be careful before adding anything not specified in the subject. Any bonuses that are not listed as a mod won't earn you any points.</p>
            <p>The only bonuses that will earn you points are a little story or lore and a beautiful and colorful display.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Before moving on to the mods, it is mandatory to have the basics of the game.</p>
            <p>The game is a turn-by-turn RPG. You incarnate a character that challenges the Hyrule Castle, a tower composed of 10 floors. Each floor you encounter an enemy and on the last floor, you challenge the Boss.</p>
            <p>For now, your character will be Link. He has 60 maximum health points (HP) and 15 strength (STR).</p>
            <p>Each fight you will face a Bokoblin which has 30 HP and 5 STR.</p>
            <p>For the 10th floor boss, you will have to defeat "Ganon" who will have 150 HP and 20 STR.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During each fight, you have the choice between "Attack" and "Heal":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Attack" deals damages to the opponent equal to the <b>STR</b> stat of the character</li>
                <li>"Heal" will heal the character by half of his maximum <b>HP</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>After your character's turn, the opponent attacks and deals damages equal to his str.</p>
            <p>When the opponent's HPs fall to 0, he is defeated and the character climbs one more floor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When the character's HPs fall to 0, he dies and the game stops.</p>
            <p>If the boss is defeated, the game stops with a message of congratulations.</p>

            <p>The player character will be fetched from the <b>players.csv</b> file (<a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/Wijme8CY">pastebin</a>).</p>
            <p>The enemies will be fetched from the <b>enemies.csv</b> file (<a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/GZwwxhiK">pastebin</a>).</p>

            <p>Now that you have done the base game and added a bit of dynamism to the characters, let's move on to the mods. Your game is boring and unattractive but with a few tweaks, you can make it much more interesting.</p>
            <p>You can start adding mods to your game. Be careful to respect the prerequisites for each mods, you can't be corrected otherwise.</p>
            <p>Every mods' explanations are given in the <code>Better_Combat_Options.html</code>, <code>Basic_Characteristics.html</code> and <code>Basic_Game_Customization.html</code> files.</p>
